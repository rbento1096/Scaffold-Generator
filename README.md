# Scaffold-Generator
Automatic modelling of CAD models of Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering using Rhinoceros' built-in Python libraries

This was my first script ever, so it looks pretty awful. 
I haven't found the need to improve it as the printer I was using on the thesis is incampable of printing these parts.
Nonetheless it will stay here as it worked with some other printers (PLA)
